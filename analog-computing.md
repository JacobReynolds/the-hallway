I don't really have a lot to put here yet, but the space of analog computing is insane. This interest was sparked by [this Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg). In it, they discuss [Mythic AI](https://mythic.ai/) and how they're flashing analog computers with the weights of neural networks. Interestingly enough, [the CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-henry-72204123/) they interviewed eventually left Mythic and was the Interim CPO at [groq](https://groq.com/) which is all the rage at the time of writing. He has since left there, but interesting to see he's been at the ground level of some really breakthrough stuff.
