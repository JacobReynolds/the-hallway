# Podcast

Various snippets, notes from podcasts that I've listened to that I'd like to remember.

## Business Made Simple with Donald Miller

### #142: Marlee Joseph - The Secret to Making Better Marketing Decisions

#### ICE Framework

This is Marlee's framework for making marketing decisions. The whole team grades on this rubric, I'm unsure on how they create a quantitative score from this though.

| Letter | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| I      | Impact      |
| C      | Confidence  |
| E      | Ease        |

They also discussed the HPPO framework (highest paid persons' opinion), which was a funny acronym I hadn't heard before.
