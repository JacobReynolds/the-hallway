# neural networks

This is my working area for my current machine learning research. I'm starting back at the basics to try and rebuild my foundational knowledge. Most of this is my note taking while following Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) course on Youtube. Fun fact: did you know he was [badmephisto](https://www.youtube.com/@badmephisto)?!?! I used his cubing tutorials a decade ago, insane.

!!!danger Warning
This section is a heavy work in progress and contains many factual inaccuracies. Additionally, it's a summation of various materials I've used to teach myself and they may not all be attributed. Nothing in here is a novel idea and was usually taken from somewhere else. I try to credit sources where appropriate.
