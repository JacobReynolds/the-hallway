# ðŸ¤– AI X-Prize (WIP)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Iâ€™ve been thinking we need an X-Prize style competition for indie builders aiming to hit $100M in revenue with less than 10 employees ðŸ¤”<br><br>Feels timely andâ€¦ doable. <a href="https://t.co/PzzZyTj05h">https://t.co/PzzZyTj05h</a></p>&mdash; Bryce Roberts (@bryce) <a href="https://twitter.com/bryce/status/1753173575157334275?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This tweet by [@bryce](https://x.com/bryce) (what a flex of a twitter handle) is pretty interesting to me. Far more attainable than Sam Altman's referenced video discussing a $1B single-person company and something that could come with a lot of exciting challenges to solve.

## What it takes

What does it actually take to grow a business to $100M in revenue? Notice I said _revenue_ not _valuation_. Going down this path you have two major considerations, B2B or B2C. And if you're like me, you're thinking you want to do whichever one is easiest. My experience is exclusively in B2B SaaS and while B2C likely would be the easier route (if you know what you're doing) I have nothing of value to provide there. Why would B2C be easier? Mainly because your primary human-driven interaction with your users would be support, which already has a large amount of ai-driven providers. When you get into B2B, especially enterprise B2B, it's all about human interactions, relationships, and sales. And since our goal is to minimize the humans on our team, that presents a challenge. Given that I'm a hermit and enjoy programming alone in a room, trying to find ways to automate the human out of the equation is enticing enough to look into.

## B2B challenges

So you want to start a $100M B2B business? Let's take you through that journey and see what problems you'll encounter during it. Remember, our goal here is to keep full-time headcount under 10 people. I might cheat and use some agencies here and there, consider it an any% glitched speedrun.

### First million

This is, funnily enough, likely to be the easiest part. At least as far as the AI stuff goes. Thousands of businesses have scaled to $1M in revenue with less than 10 people. In the enterprise B2B space, assume your ACV is $50k, that's only 20 customers. Let's also assume you close 10% of deals that make it to the first meeting, that's 200 meetings. Which is definitely doable for a founder-led sales process.

What AI is needed at this point? Really none, but it'd be good to set some groundwork. Let's go ahead and get that set up.

- [x] Customer support fully automated
- [x] Any developers we have are using a co-pilot
- [x] Email is primarily driven by AI using something like [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/)
- [x] All scheduling is done via a scheduler like [cal.com](https://cal.com)

What does our team look like so far?

- [x] Founder
- [x] Founding engineer (x2)
- [x] Head of AI Operations
  - This is a very important role. Almost like a COO, but for AI within your company. They should be ruthlessly focused on removing process and replacing it with AI.

## Non-artificial Intelligence

Now you might be saying, "scheduling apps don't use AI'. And you'd be mostly right. This is an important distinction in this journey. The benefit of AI is offloading things humans can do (or can't do) and having a computer do it for them. When it comes to scheduling, how can I offload my management of it? Since there's likely a human person on the other end of scheduling this meeting, why not just make _them_ my AI?! The more I can provide a machine-driven interface into interactions with me and my team, the less we have to manage the fluff.
