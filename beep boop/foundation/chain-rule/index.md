# Chain Rule

The chain rule, in simple terms, says that if you have a composite function `f(g(x))` and want to take the derivative of it, you can do `f'(g(x)) * g'(x)` . I.e. the derivative of the composite function is the inner function within the derivative of the outer function, multiplied by the derivative of the inner function.
