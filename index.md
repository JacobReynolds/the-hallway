# Intro

![Glad to see ya](https://imgur.com/wGqSb.gif)
Thanks for checking out the hallway. You can think of this place as a dumping grounds for everything in my brain. I've learned that while I'm a great learner, I have terrible retention of knowledge. If I don't write something down, it's lost to time one way or another. You'll find various areas of my brain on the left-hand side.
