This is my working area for my current machine learning research. I'm starting back at the basics to try and rebuild my foundational knowledge. Most of this is my note taking while following Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) course on Youtube. Fun fact: did you know he was [badmephisto](https://www.youtube.com/@badmephisto)?!?! I used his cubing tutorials a decade ago, insane.

This section is heavily in progress and contains many inaccuracies.
